A simple program that pings a specified destination and logs if the ping requst timesout as a packet lost


1.0.0.5:
    Features:
        Auto update
        Run at startup
        start the program when it runs(only when "Run at system start up" box is checked)
        Load default configuration button
        plus other simple things im lazy to write atm
    Issues:
        Logs keep accumulating in the program, the longer you run it the more logs you will have
        Probably many other things i dont know about
